Subject: Laws of Indices
Question: \( \left(5^{4}\right)^{3}= \)
Answer: \( 125^{12} \)

RESPONSE
Raw: The underlying misconception is the incorrect application of the laws of indices, specifically misunderstanding how to multiply exponents when raising a power to another power, leading to the erroneous belief that \( (a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n} \) results in \( 125^{12} \) instead of correctly simplifying to \( 5^{12} \).

Answer: Both Tom and Katie

RESPONSE
Raw: The underlying misconception is that the term "regular polygon" is being incorrectly applied to both triangles and parallelograms, leading to the belief that any shape with equal sides or angles qualifies as a regular polygon, rather than recognizing that only polygons with all sides and angles equal are considered regular.

    Answer: Both Tom and Katie

RESPONSE
Raw: The underlying misconception is that individuals may mistakenly believe that any shape with equal sides or angles qualifies as a regular polygon, without recognizing that a regular polygon must have all sides and angles equal, which is not the case for a parallelogram.

RESPONSE
Raw: The underlying misconception is that the individual incorrectly assumes that the total sum of the sections labeled "P" is simply the product of the number of sections (3) and the value of \( P \), without recognizing that the total sum of those sections should equal 615, leading to a miscalculation of \( P \).

Raw: The underlying misconception is the confusion between the operation of exponentiation and the result of adding or counting, leading to the incorrect assumption that \( 1^{2} \) somehow equals \( 2 \) instead of recognizing that any number raised to any power remains that number if it is \( 1 \).

Which number could this be?
    Answer: \( 20074 \)

RESPONSE
Raw: The underlying misconception is that the person believes that any number within a certain range can round to the same value across different place values, without recognizing that the rounding thresholds differ for each place value.
Top 5 predictions:

    Question: What number is \( 100 \) more than \( 28902 ? \)
    Answer: \( 28,002 \)

RESPONSE
Raw: The underlying misconception is that the individual misinterprets the addition of \( 100 \) as a manipulation of the digits rather than a straightforward arithmetic operation, leading them to incorrectly rearrange the digits instead of correctly calculating \( 28902 + 100 \).
Top 5 predictions:

    Question: What is the first term of the sequence given by this rule:
\[
4 n+3
\]
    Answer: \( 4 \)

RESPONSE
Raw: The underlying misconception is that the person incorrectly believes that the first term of the sequence corresponds to the coefficient of \( n \) in the expression, rather than evaluating the expression at \( n = 1 \).
Top 5 predictions:
0.7692 | When finding the nth term of a linear sequence, thinks the the first term is the coefficient in front of n.

    Question: What number is \( 100 \) more than \( 72980 ? \)
    Answer: \( 73,980 \)

RESPONSE
Raw: The underlying misconception is that the person incorrectly interpreted the question as asking for the number formed by adding \( 100 \) to the digits of \( 72980 \) rather than calculating the numerical value that is \( 100 \) greater than \( 72980 \).

One of the polygons has been rotated through 90 degrees.]() Katie says these two shapes are congruent ![Two 6-sided "L shape" polygons. One of the polygons has a wider upright section than the other.]() Who is correct?
    Answer: Only Katie

RESPONSE
Raw: The underlying misconception is that congruency is based on the dimensions and proportions of the shapes rather than their ability to be transformed into one another through rotation or reflection.
Top 5 predictions:
0.7913 | Does not understand that shapes are congruent if they have the same size and shape

    Answer: \( 0.16 \)

RESPONSE
Raw: The underlying misconception is that the person mistakenly believes that squaring a decimal involves simply multiplying the decimal by itself without properly accounting for the decimal places, leading them to incorrectly calculate \( 0.8 \times 0.8 \) as \( 0.16 \) instead of the correct \( 0.64 \).
