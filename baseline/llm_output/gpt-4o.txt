RESPONSE
Raw: The misconception is that the person incorrectly added the numerators and denominators separately, thinking \(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1+1}{3+10} = \frac{2}{13}\), and then mistakenly scaled the denominator to 30 without properly finding a common denominator and adjusting the numerators accordingly.

The vertical height of the bottom rectangle is labelled 4cm. The top rectangle is shaded.]()
Answer: \( 60 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \)

RESPONSE
Raw: The misconception likely arises from incorrectly calculating the area of the shaded section by multiplying the total height of the composite shape by the total base length, rather than isolating and calculating the dimensions of the shaded rectangle separately.
Top 5 predictions:
0.6879 | When calculating the area of a rectilinear compound shape, calculates the are of the surrounding rectangle

Answer: \( 2 \)

RESPONSE
Raw: The misconception is that the person incorrectly subtracted \( \frac{1}{4} \) from the output \( 8 \) instead of recognizing that the input should be \( 8 - \frac{1}{4} \), leading them to mistakenly calculate \( 8 - 6 = 2 \).

Question: What temperature does the thermometer show? ![A thermometer showing the temperature in degrees Celsius. There are five steps on the scale between 10 and 0, and five steps between 0 and -10. The temperature is shown at 4 steps below 0.]()
Answer: \( -9^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \)

RESPONSE
Raw: The misconception is misunderstanding the scale of the thermometer, leading to the incorrect assumption that each step represents 2 degrees instead of 1 degree, resulting in the incorrect calculation of the temperature as \(-9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) instead of the correct \(-4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\).

RESPONSE
Raw: The misconception is that the person incorrectly applied the term-to-term rule by adding \( -5 \) to the first term instead of subtracting \( 5 \) from each subsequent term, leading them to mistakenly calculate the \( 10^{\text{th}} \) term as \( 50 \) instead of correctly subtracting \( 5 \) nine times from \( 100 \).

Subject: Multiplying Terms
Question: Which of the following expressions is equivalent to:
\(

Answer: \( 8 p^{2} \)

RESPONSE
Raw: The misconception is failing to correctly apply the power of a power rule, which states that when raising a power to another power, you multiply the exponents, leading to the incorrect simplification of \( (2p^2)^3 \) as \( 8p^2 \) instead of the correct \( 8p^6 \).

The bottom side of the rectangle is 3 squares up from the bottom of the grid. The bottom left corner of the rectangle is marked with the letter P, which is 3 squares up from the bottom of the grid and 3 squares to the left of the red line. The bottom right corner of the rectangle is marked with the letter Q, which is 3 squares up from the bottom of the grid on the red line. ]() Tom and Katie are discussing reflections

Tom says if you reflect the rectangle in the vertical line, Point \( P \) stays in the same position

Katie says if you reflect the rectangle in the vertical line, Point \( Q \) stays in the same position
Who is correct?

RESPONSE
Raw: The misconception is that a fraction cannot be simplified if it has a prime number as either the numerator or denominator, ignoring that simplification depends on the greatest common divisor between the numerator and denominator, not their primality.

Answer: \( \frac{6}{10} \)

RESPONSE
Raw: The misconception is confusing the roles of \( x \) and \( y \) in the equation, leading to incorrectly solving for \( x \) when \( y = 0 \) by dividing the coefficients instead of setting the equation \( 10 - 6x = 0 \) and solving for \( x \).

Subject: Gradient as change in y over change in x
Question: If you were to write the equation of this line in the form \( \boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{m} \boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{c} \), what is the value of \( \boldsymbol{m} \) ? ![Graph showing straight line with y intercept (0,0) and x intercept (0,0). Also goes through the point (6,-4)]()
Answer: \( -\frac{3}{2} \)

Subject: Quadratic Sequences
Question: Tom and Katie are discussing quadratic sequences.

Tom says this is a quadratic sequence: \( 3,5,10,17,26, \ldots \)

Katie says this is a quadratic sequence: \( 3,6,12,24,48, \ldots \)

Who is correct?
Answer: Only Tom

RESPONSE
Raw: The misconception is that Katie incorrectly identifies a geometric sequence, where each term is multiplied by a constant factor, as a quadratic sequence, which actually requires a constant second difference between consecutive terms.

Who is correct?
Answer: Both Jo and Paul

RESPONSE
Raw: The misconception is that both Jo and Paul misunderstand the properties of exponents, as Jo incorrectly equates \( 9^4 \) with \( 3^8 \) by failing to recognize that \( 9 \) is \( 3^2 \), and Paul incorrectly simplifies \( 9^4 \) to \( 3^2 \times 3^2 \) instead of correctly expressing it as \( (3^2)^4 = 3^8 \).
